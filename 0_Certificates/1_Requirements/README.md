# Calculator

## Description:-

Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this which I'm Implementing, also included two additional operations such as power and reminder.

The input includes the command such that we can give numbers based on the operation that we want to perform. For example the operation we needed is addition, we have to enter 1 as a command and that particular operation works.

## Requirement:-

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator "%" is used with data values. To print the remainder operator "%%" is used in the first "printf()" function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1 and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with the case label in whuch the case label statements are executed and display result on the screen. If the entered operator does not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen.

## High Level Requirements:-

* User should able to viewe operation list.
* User should able to select the operation.
* The system sould perform the given operation.
* The system should display the correct result.

## Low Level Requirements:-

* User  needs a system.

## Swot Analysis:-

### Strength

It is innovative,user-friendly and long lasting.

### Weakness

Does not inlude all the operations rather have only addition,subtraction multiplication, division, power and reminder.

### Threats

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
